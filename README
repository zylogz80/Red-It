About Red It:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Red It is a Reddit browser for the TouchPad.

Red It is free software under the terms of the GPLv3. See the COPYING
file for more information. 


Installing Red It:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You can download Red It from the App Catalog (so long as it continues
to function.) If the App Catalog has shut down or you are unable to
reach it for whatever reason, or if you want to run the newest bits,
you can do the following:

1. Install the webOS SDK:
https://developer.palm.com/content/resources/develop/sdk_pdk_download.html

2. Put your device into developer mode
- Click on the "Just Type" bar
- Enter upupdowndownleftrightleftrightbastart into the "Just Type" bar
- Click the "Developer Mode" icon that appears

3. USB tether your device to your computer

4. Run the included makeinstall.sh script

The app should now appear in the app launcher. You can use the two included
log scripts to view error and debug logs. These are simple 1 or 2 line scripts
made out of laziness. Feel free to use them or not.

Questions, help, or comments:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a "Help" option under the app menu (in the upper left corner)
that will email me. You can also email me directly. 

Thanks:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To the people who beta tested Red It and the people who answered my
questions on #webOS.
